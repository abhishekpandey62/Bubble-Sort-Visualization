# Bubble Sort Visualization

This project visualizes the **Bubble Sort** algorithm using Java's `Swing` and `AWT` libraries. It demonstrates how the algorithm sorts a randomly shuffled array of integers through animated swaps.

## Features

- **Real-time Sorting Animation**: Observe the sorting process as each swap is animated.
- **Randomized Input**: The array is shuffled before sorting, ensuring a different experience with each run.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed with `JFrame` and `JPanel` for a clear visual representation of the sorting algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
  - Swing (for GUI)
  - AWT (for graphics)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BubbleSortVisualization.git
